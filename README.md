# Deep_neural_networks_utilities
This is a small Deep neural networks utilities written in pure python and numpy.

it allows to write different kindes of deep neural networks with fewer lines of code.
it offers many popular activation and loss functions ans well as optimizers (such as adam and momentum).

this utilies can be used by people that are in the process of learning about deep neural networks , since the code is well documented and made easy to read . Also it it gives more flexibility to create highly customized DNNs and experiment on them quickly. (however it is no where comparable with the known ML framworks but it does the job quit well)

ps: This small project was created just to allow me learn how DNNs exactly work and how i can create my custom NN and experiment with it . So i hope this can help someone else going through the same road.
